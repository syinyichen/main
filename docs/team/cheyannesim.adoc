== PROJECT: Sharkie

---

== Overview

Sharkie is a desktop expense tracker application. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancements*:
** Added People's command, `owe`
*** What it does: allows the user to keep track of what they owe to other people in the addressbook.
*** Justification: This is one of the main feature of Sharkie.
*** Highlights: The implementation was quite challenging as it required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. For instance, how to store the Transactions,
since a Transaction has association to Description, Amount, Date and Tag, and Date itself have different formats to consider. I have implemented the logic, model,
storage and ui for this command.
** Added People's command, `returned`
*** What it does: allows the user to record that he/she has already returned the debt(s).
** Modified People's command, `find`
*** What it does: allows the user to find people based on their name, phone, email or tags.
I have also added the the tags "Debt" and "Loan" to people whom the user owes and lends, so that the user
can filter the people whom they lend or owe using the commands `people find t/debt` and `people find t/loan` respectively.

* *Minor enhancements*:
** Edit existing AB3 commands
*** Removed address field of AB3 as it is unnecessary for Sharkie.
